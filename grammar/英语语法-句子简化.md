​    b. Tell me how I can get to the bus station.

#### 定语从句

**逻辑思路：从句--->短语(只有关系词做主语时可简化)**

**从句有be动词：去掉be动词and关系代词**

##### 主动：现在分词；被动：过去分词；形容词短语也可

​    c. The people who were responsible for the incident were all punished.

##### 从句没有be动词：去掉关系代词；动词--->现在分词

​    a. They live in a room that faces the south.

​      They live in a room facing the south.

​    b. English has an alphabet that consists of 26 letters.

​      English has an alphabet consisting of 26 letters.

##### 不定式替换：the only，the last，the next，序数词，最高级修饰的名词

​    a. The only one that understands me.

​      The only one to understand me.

​    b. The next train that arrives is from New York.

​    c. Jango was the second person that fell into this trap.

#### 状语从句

**注意：主句从句的主语相同时，才可以简化。**

**有be动词：去掉be动词(常见：时间，地点，条件，让步)**

##### 主动：现在分词；被动：过去分词；形容词or名词短语也可

​    a. Metals expand when heated and contract when (they are) cooled.

​    b. When (he was) a student in the university, he read a lot.

​    c. while (he was) waitting, he took out a magazine to read.

​    d. A tiger can’t be tamed unless (it is) caught very young. 

##### 没有be动词：从句主语省略，动词变成现在分词

​    a. Since I came to Beijing, I have made many new friends.

​      Since coming to Beijing, I have made many new friends.

​    b. After I finished my homework, I fed the dog.
