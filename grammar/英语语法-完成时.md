#### 现在完成时(一)：开始于过去的动作一直持续到现在，有可能继续持续。谓语动词为延续性动词

  I have lived here for 3 years. 我仍然住在这里，而且还可能继续住下去。

​    **如果在搬家时说这句话，则live这件事只持续到目前为止。**

  The teacher has taught in this school since I came here. <!-- more -->

  I’ve worked in this company since I left school.

​      **since表明了动作开始的时间点。**

​    a. A: Have you waited long?

​      B: I’ve waited for three hours.

​    b. I’ve waited for him all day; I don’t want to wait any longer.

##### 特点：

  1. 谓语动词为延续性动词

  2. 动作的发生时间是过去，持续到现在，还可能继续持续下去。

  3. 常常与表示一段时间的时间状语连用，是说明某个状态持续了多久。

##### 与现在完成时搭配的时间状语

​    **改正：**

​         b. It’s 3 years since he left this home town.

​         c. He hasn’t come back since he left his hometown 3 years ago.

​         d. He has been away from his home town for 3 years.

  **2. 终止性动词的完成时句子若用否定，表示尚未发生的事情，则可以为一种状态，从而表示延续。**

​    a. I haven’t seen a film for weeks.

​    b. I haven’t heard form my girlfriends since I came to America

​    c. I haven’t bought a pair of shoes for a year.

​    c. Has it stopped raining yet?

​    d. He has  already arrived.

​    f.  I have often thought that it would be perfect if we could fly without any aid.

  **4. 具有新闻性质：表示最近才发生的动作，提供新消息。有新闻性质**

​    a. The President has been assassinated.

​    b. He can’t go on holiday because he has broken his leg.

​    **强调的时间内容，而不算是发生的过去具体时间。**

​    **通常的日常对话，以现在完成时开始问答。过去时间咋唉说话人的脑子中已经确定了，则继续用一般过去时。**

​    c. I hear that famous Chinese comedian has died.

##### 现在完成时与一般过去时比较

  **不同时态，表明了说话的时间不同。**

  a. I haven’t seen him this morning.

  b. I didn’t see him this morning.

  a. 句用了现在完成时，而完成时生死要与现在发生联系的。所以a说话的时间是this morning

  b. 句用的是一般过去时，说明this morning已经成为了过去，所以b说话时间是今早后

  c. I have called thim three times this morning.

  d. I called thim three times this morning.

  c. 表示到现在为止的一个是时间段内重复的动作。所以c说话时间是this morning

  d. 过去时，和现在没有什么联系，所以说话时间是今早后
