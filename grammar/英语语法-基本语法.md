#### 五种句型

**学习语法：分析句子=>理清句子成分=>理清句子关系**

**句子基本结构：主语部分+谓语部分（名词+动词）**

##### 五种句型：

+ 主 谓 表     I am a Webaholic <!-- more -->

+ 主 谓       Internet dating hurts

+ 主 谓 宾     I like chatting online

+ 主 谓 间宾 主宾  Chatting on the internet brings me a lot of fun

+ 主 谓 宾 宾补   We can call Internet addicts a Webaholic

   **关键在于谓语动词：动词构成了一个句子的骨架**

##### 1 主语+系动词+主语补足语（表语）

 **系动词（Linking Verb）**

   作用：无具体动作，仅起连接作用； 

   后面所接成分：说明主语特点性质特征

   **种类：be动词（am is are）**

​      look sound smell taste feel seem appear become turn

 **表语：名词 or 形容词**

##### 2 主语+谓语（+状语）

 **不及物动词（Intransitive Verb）vi**

   特点：主语自身可以完成，不需要作用对象

   习惯：带状语（修饰动作的成分）

##### 3 主语+谓语+宾语

 **及物动词（Transitive Verb）vt**

   作用；：说明主语动作作用对象（宾语：主语动作承受对象）

##### 4 主语+谓语+间宾+直宾

 **双宾动词（Dative Verb）**

   特点：后面成分有人（间接宾语[接受者]）又有物（直接宾语[承受者]）

##### 5 主语+谓语+宾语+宾语补足语

 **宾补动词（Factitive Verb）**

##### 6 区分双宾语和复合宾语

 **在间接宾语后加上be动词，若能成句，则是补足语。**
